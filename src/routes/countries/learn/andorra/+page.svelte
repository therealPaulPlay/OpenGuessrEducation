	Andorra is a small country located <b>between France and Spain</b>. It is in the middle of the <b>pyrenees</b>, a
	mountain range, which makes it quite easy to identify as the landscape is mountainous, and with many houses made of
	stone.
</p>
<ArticleTip>These stone buildings are typical in the Pyrenean areas near Andorra, both in France and Spain.</ArticleTip>

	Islands.

<p class="mb-2">Roads in Andorra are divided into two different categories:</p>
<ul class="mb-2 list-disc list-inside">
	<li>
		<b>Main Roads</b>: CG-[1-6]. CG-1 is the main road. It goes from the capital to Spain. Meanwhile, CG-2 goes to
		France. There are small variations called CG-1A and CG-2A located next to these two roads.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Secondary roads</b>: CS-[1XX-5XX]. Numbers are derived from CG numbers (e.g. CS-38 is near CG-3).
	</li>
