	On the PlonkIt website, you can compete against others in their own <b>ranked format</b>. There, the game modes are
	different compared to GeoGuessr's ranked Duels mode, and you will be matched up against other players by
	<b>community members</b> on their Discord Server. Moreover, you can also try to beat records on their leaderboards for
	GeoGuessr maps.
