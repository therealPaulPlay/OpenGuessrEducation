<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">GeoGuessr World Cup</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
	To qualify for the GeoGuessr World Cup, you first have to be a <b>high-ranked</b> player in GeoGuessr to receive an
	invitation. Then, you will be able to play against other qualified players in various stages, such as the group stage.
	<b>Wildcard Events</b>
	can also help you secure a seat at the World Cup. The World Cup is an <b>in-person</b> event with a $50,000 prize pool.

<p class="mb-2">
	On the PlonkIt website, you can compete against others in their own <b>ranked format</b>. There, the game modes are
	different compared to GeoGuessr's ranked Duels mode, and you will be matched up against other players by
	<b>community members</b> on their Discord Server. Moreover, you can also try to beat records on their leaderboards for
	GeoGuessr maps.
