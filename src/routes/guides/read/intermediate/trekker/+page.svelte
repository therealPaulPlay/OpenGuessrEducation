<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Trekker Coverage</h1>
<p class="mb-2">
	<b>Trekker coverage</b> refers to imagery captured in places where vehicles are unable to travel. Using a
	<b>Trekker camera</b>, often carried by a person on foot, these systems are used to map and photograph areas that are
	otherwise inaccessible, such as <b>mountain trails</b>, <b>narrow historical streets</b>, or <b>dense forests</b>.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">What does a trekker-camera look like?</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
	The <b>Trekker camera</b> is a backpack-mounted device with a distinctive, large <b>spherical camera</b> above the
	carrier's head. Equipped with multiple lenses to capture <b>360-degree panoramic views</b>, it is designed to endure
	long walks on rough terrains, providing clear images of locations unreachable by cars or bikes. For instance, you
	might spot Trekker footage in locations like the remote temples of <b>Machu Picchu</b> or deep within <b>forests</b>.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Why is it useful for guessing?</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
	<b>Trekker coverage</b> does not feature traditional hints like road signs or bollards. Instead, it is more important
	to observe <b>natural clues</b>, such as the type of vegetation, unique rock formations, or even specific styles of
	paths and walkways. Trekker coverage is quite common in <b>North America</b>, e. g. near the Niagara Falls, in
	<b>New Zealand</b>
	and <b>Thailand</b>. Moreover, <b>Belarus</b> currently <b>only</b> has
	<b>Trekker coverage</b>.
</p>

<ArticleTip>
	If you notice there are no cars, wide streets, or typical road features, you're likely viewing a Trekker-captured
	location.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Exploring remote places</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
	Trekker coverage often takes you off the beaten path, exposing you to <b>remote landscapes</b> and
	<b>cultural treasures</b> rarely seen on traditional maps. For example, you might find yourself virtually exploring ancient
	ruins in Cambodia, dense jungle trails in Thailand, or rugged mountain passes in America.
