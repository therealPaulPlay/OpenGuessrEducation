<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Road Lines</h1>

<p class="mb-2">
	Learning road line types is a very <b>effective</b> and, at the same time, beginner-friendly way to quickly gasp a
	general idea of where an image was taken. In this guide, we will take a look at the <b>center lines</b> as well as the
	<b>outer lines</b>.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">White road lines</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
	In general, <b>Europe</b> has white center lines. Moreover, <b>Chile</b>, as the only country in South America,
	commonly uses white center lines (often double) as well. Keep in mind that <b>Norway and Finland</b> regularly use
	<b>yellow center lines</b>, usually when there is more than one center line. A tip to tell <b>Sweden</b> apart from
	<b>Finland</b>
	is to look at the <b>outer lines</b>, which are, if they aren't solid, <b>short</b> lines in <b>Sweden</b> and
	<b>long</b>
	in <b>Finland</b>. Moreover, <b>Ireland</b> uses outlines very similar to <b>Sweden</b>. <b>Estland</b> often uses
	similar dashed outer lines, though, with a <b>wider margin</b> to the edges.

<p class="mb-4">
	<b>Double solid white</b> center road lines are most apparent near the Mediterranean sea in countries such as
	<b>Greece</b>, but they are also common in <b>Poland</b> and <b>Denmark</b>. Another great tip is that
	<b>Ireland and New Zealand</b>
	frequently have <b>yellow dashed outer lines</b> with <b>white center lines</b>. <b>Malaysia</b> often uses double white
	center lines as well.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Yellow center lines</h2>

<p class="mb-2">
	In general, <b>North- and South America</b> have yellow center lines. In the US, there are usually
	<b>two center lines</b>, whereas a <b>single center line</b> is more common in <b>Canada</b> or <b>Mexico</b>.
	However, there are exceptions. While <b>Chile</b> often uses white center lines, there are rare occasions in which
	<b>all lines are yellow </b>
	(center & outer), which is rather <b>exclusive</b> to Chile. Other notable countries with yellow center lines are
	<b>Thailand</b>
	and <b>Cambodia</b>.

<p class="mb-4">
	<b>Argentina</b> frequently uses <b>white lines </b>, although <b>yellow</b> ones are more common. <b>Uruguay</b>
	oftentimes uses a combination of white and yellow for their center line, which is also common in the
	<b>Phillipines</b>.
</p>

<img alt="Uruguay road" src="/assets/guides/uruguay_road.png" class="rounded-xl w-full" />

<p class="text-center mt-2">Roads in the Phillipines and Uruguay sometimes combine yellow and white.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Yellow border lines</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
	Yellow border lines are a good indicator that the imagery was captured in <b
		>South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana or Eswatini</b
	>. Moreover, in the <b>UAE, Quatar or Jordan</b> often use yellow outer lines. It's also notable that in many scenarios,
	no border lines exist.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Mixed road line colors in Asia and Africa</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
	In regions like <b><i>Asia</i></b> and <b><i>Africa</i></b>, you will often encounter <b>mixed line colors</b>.<br />
	For example, countries like the <b><i>Philippines and Thailand</i></b> frequently use <b>concrete roads</b> that can
	help identify their location.<br />
	<b><i>In Malaysia</i></b>, you will typically find only <b>white lines</b> with frequent use of
	<b>double white center lines</b>.<br />
	<b><i>Indonesia</i></b> often features a mix of both <b>yellow and white lines</b>.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Additional tips for identification:</h3>
<ul class="mb-2 list-disc list-inside">
	<li>The absence of outer lines does not exclude countries with characteristic outer lines.</li>
	<li>
		<strong><i>Estonia </i></strong>&nbsp;often has <b>short dashed outer lines</b> similar to Sweden but with
		<b>more space</b> from the roadside.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Paved concrete roads in Southeast Asia</b> often indicate locations like the
		<b><i>Philippines or Thailand.</i></b>
	</li>
</ul>
