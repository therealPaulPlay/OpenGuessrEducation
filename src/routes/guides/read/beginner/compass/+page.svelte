<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">How to "line up"</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
	The compass can help you find out which geographical features you are seeing in the street view. To <b>line up</b> the
	street view with the map, rotate the camera so that the <b>compass points north</b> and then tilt the view so that the
	ground becomes visible. This way, you can scan for roads, coastlines or other landmarks on the minimap that follow the
	same direction as the geographical feature, because the
	<b>minimap always points north</b>. In <b>OpenGuessr</b>, you can also simply <b>click</b> on the <b>compass</b> to
	rotate the view to face <b>north</b>.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">The two hemispheres</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
	Not everyone is familiar with the earth's two hemispheres, so here is a short explanation. <br />
	The equator splits the planet earth into two halves, a northern (upper) and a southern (lower) half. For example, Europe
	is located entirely in the northern hemisphere, whereas Oceania sits in the southern hemisphere.
