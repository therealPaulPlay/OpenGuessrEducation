<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Map Basics</h1>
<p class="mb-2">
	A map refers to a <b>set of locations</b> that will be chosen
	<b>at random</b> when you play - well, it's not quite random, as the game keeps track of your previous locations to prevent
	repeats. Even game modes that do not expicitly name a map that they use, get their locations from a map. Let's take a look
	at a few specifics.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Official vs. Community Maps</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
	In all three major guessing games, user created maps are available and known as community maps. Moreover, they include
	pages that showcase these maps.

<p class="mb-4">
	Many advanced players prefer community maps, as they often offer a <b>more varied distribution</b>
	compared to official maps. Many official maps over-represent countries or areas that have more street view coverage (meaning,
	more panorama images), which makes them less interesting to play.<br /><br />Additionally,
	<b>community maps</b>
	often include a lot
	<b>more locations</b> than their official counterparts. However, in OpenGuessr, the <b>standard map</b> gets
	<b>regenerated constantly</b> to feature a near infinite amount of places.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">General Terms</h2>

<p class="mb-4">Let's now take a look at a few terms that are often being used by players when talking about maps:</p>

<ol class="mb-2 list-disc list-inside">
	<li class="mb-2">
		<b>Pinpointability:</b> Pinpointable means, that locations are easy to precisely locate on the map. This is possible,
		when a distinct feature can be identified, such as a road sign or a famous building.
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2">
		<b>Distribution:</b> Terms such as country size, coverage density and landscape diversity are often being used when describing
		maps. Balanced usually means that players are as likely to be dropped in a small country and/or a country with litle
		coverag as being presented with a panorama from a large nation.
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2">
		<b>Handpicked / Arbitrarily generated:</b> While some maps feature handpicked locations, others were created using computer
		algorithms, that are sometimes falsely being referred to as "AI generated".
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2">
		<b>Official / Unofficial coverage:</b> These terms refer to street view, which has both images captured by Google (=
		official coverage), as well as images that were taken by users of the platform.
	</li>
</ol>
