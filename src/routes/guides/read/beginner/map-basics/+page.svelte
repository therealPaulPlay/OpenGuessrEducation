<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Map Basics</h1>
<p class="mb-2">
    A map refers to a <b>set of locations</b> that will be chosen
    <b>at random</b> when you play - well, it's not quite random, as the game keeps
    track of your previous locations to prevent repeats. Even game modes that do
    not expicitly name a map that they use, get their locations from a map. Let's
    take a look at a few specifics.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Official vs. Community Maps</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
    In all three major guessing games, user created maps are available and known
    as community maps. Moreover, they include pages that showcase these maps.

<p class="mb-4">
    Many advanced players prefer community maps, as they often offer a <b
        >more varied distribution</b>
    compared to official maps. Many official maps over-represent countries or
    areas that have more street view coverage (meaning, more panorama images),
    which makes them less interesting to play.<br /><br />Additionally,
    <b>community maps</b>
    often include a lot
    <b>more locations</b> than their official counterparts. However, in
    OpenGuessr, the <b>standard map</b> gets <b>regenerated constantly</b> to feature
    a near infinite amount of places.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">General Terms</h2>

<p class="mb-4">
    Let's now take a look at a few terms that are often being used by players
    when talking about maps:
</p>

<ol class="mb-2 list-disc list-inside">
    <li class="mb-2">
        <b>Pinpointability:</b> Pinpointable means, that locations are easy to precisely
        locate on the map. This is possible, when a distinct feature can be identified,
        such as a road sign or a famous building.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
        <b>Distribution:</b> Terms such as country size, coverage density and landscape
        diversity are often being used when describing maps. Balanced usually means
        that players are as likely to be dropped in a small country and/or a country
        with litle coverag as being presented with a panorama from a large nation.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
        <b>Handpicked / Arbitrarily generated:</b> While some maps feature handpicked
        locations, others were created using computer algorithms, that are sometimes
        falsely being referred to as "AI generated".
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
        <b>Official / Unofficial coverage:</b> These terms refer to street view,
        which has both images captured by Google (= official coverage), as well as
        images that were taken by users of the platform.
    </li>
</ol>
