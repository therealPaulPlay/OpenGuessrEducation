<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Restrictions & NMPZ</h1>

<p class="mb-2">
	This guide will explain the term <b>NMPZ</b> as well as the specific ways to control a panorama. Moreover, we will be
	going over different <b>restrictions</b> for matches. Taking away some or all of these ways is often
	<b>favored by professional players</b> to increase the difficulty and ensure that every player sees the same hints.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">The term "NMPZ"</h2>

<p class="mb-2">
	NMPZ stands for <b>No Move, no Pan and no Zoom</b>. Let's quickly go over these three controls.
</p>

<ol class="mb-2 list-disc list-inside">
	<li class="mb-2">
		<b>Move:</b> Move refers to moving around in the panorama using the controls. You can learn how to use them
		effectively in the guides on <a class="text-secondary" href="/guides/read/beginner/fast-movement">fast movement</a>
		and <a class="text-secondary" href="/guides/read/beginner/shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>.
	</li>
	<li class="mb-2"><b>Pan:</b> Pan refers to the action of changing the view or angle of the 360-degree image.</li>
	<li class="mb-2">
		<b>Zoom:</b> This describes the action of zooming in or out of the image using the mouse wheel or + and - buttons.
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="mb-2">
	Oftentimes, these controls are being enabled or disabled to make for interesting restrictions. Especially "No-Move" is
	quite popular in the GeoGuessr community.
